A third-year PhD Student in Data Science at the School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh supervised by [Dr Sara Wade](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~swade/). Also a member of the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Science](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/epsrc-cdt-in-data-science/) and [Maxwell Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://www.maxwell.ac.uk/). 

I am interested in ML and statistics, specifically Bayesian inference, Bayesian Nonparametric methods, clustering, approximate inference (MCMC and variational methods).
